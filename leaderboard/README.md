# Start the configuration

Most of the variables to change for a default leaderboard are in `src/env.py` (replace the path for your leaderboard) and `src/about.py` (for tasks).

Results files should have the following format and be stored as json files:
```json
{
    "config": {
        "model_dtype": "torch.float16", # or torch.bfloat16 or 8bit or 4bit
        "model_name": "path of the model on the hub: org/model",
        "model_sha": "revision on the hub",
    },
    "results": {
        "task_name": {
            "metric_name": score,
        },
        "task_name2": {
            "metric_name": score,
        }
    }
}
```

Request files are created automatically by this tool.

If you encounter problem on the space, don't hesitate to restart it to remove the create eval-queue, eval-queue-bk, eval-results and eval-results-bk created folder.

# Code logic for more complex edits

You'll find 
- the main table' columns names and properties in `src/display/utils.py`
- the logic to read all results and request files, then convert them in dataframe lines, in `src/leaderboard/read_evals.py`, and `src/populate.py`
- the logic to allow or filter submissions in `src/submission/submit.py` and `src/submission/check_validity.py`
